# SetupNginxCompilerWindows
This File is intended to be used to setup an evironment for compiling nginx on windows as well as walking through the act of compiling the program once. 

Running this program more then once on a machine would ultimately be pointless since most of the program is collecting and instlling supporting applications that nginx or msys might need.

an and all optimizations or changes are welcome.
